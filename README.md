# High Dimensional Data Analysis with R

### Project Description:

This project focuses on applying various techniques from High Dimensional Data Analysis to a real-world dataset using R. The analysis covers a range of tasks, including data standardization, Euclidean distance calculations, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Correspondence Analysis, and Factor Modeling. The objectives are to interpret the relationships between variables and visualize the underlying structure of the data through these advanced methods. The project was implemented in R Studio with R Markdown for comprehensive documentation, allowing for a clear presentation of both code and results. This repository provides a full set of instructions and R scripts to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

### Objectives of the project:

- Data Standardization: To standardize variables for comparison by centering and scaling data.
  
- Distance Calculation: To compute Euclidean distances between observations using different sets of variables.
  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): To reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify key components that explain the variance.
  
- Multidimensional Scaling (MDS): To create a low-dimensional representation of the data, allowing for visualization of the relationships between observations.
  
- Collaborative Filtering & Jaccard Similarity: To explore distance metrics and recommendation systems for personalized content, such as movies, based on user data.
  
- Correspondence Analysis (CA): To analyze categorical data and explore relationships between categorical variables (e.g., sectors and second languages).
  
- Factor Modeling: To fit factor models to the data, exploring latent factors and relationships among variables.
  
- Visualizations: To create plots like biplots, MDS plots, and correspondence analysis plots to visualize the relationships between variables and observations.

### Technologies Used:

The project is implemented using R and documented in R Markdown to integrate both code and narrative. RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) used to write, test, and run the R scripts. The analysis utilizes various R packages such as dplyr, ggplot2, prcomp, and factanal for data manipulation, visualization, principal component analysis (PCA), and factor modeling.

### How to Run the Code:

1. Download the repository as a ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.

2. Navigate to the project folder and open the .rmd file in RStudio.

3. Before running the code, make sure you have all the necessary R packages installed.

4. Open the .Rmd file in RStudio and click the "Knit" button to run the entire code and generate the output.
